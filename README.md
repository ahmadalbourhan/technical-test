# Tashgheel Beginner Technical Test – AI-Powered Challenge

## 🎯 Objective:

This technical test is designed to evaluate your ability to think, learn, and build with support from AI tools like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot. You will work on simple coding challenges that involve both frontend and backend logic. We encourage you to use AI tools to help you and explain how you used them.

## ✅ What You’ll Do

## ✍️ Part 1: Build a Simple Full-Stack App (with AI Support)

You are asked to create a basic tool using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for the frontend, and one of the following technologies for the backend: Python, Java, PHP or .NET .

### 🎓 Context:

You are building a simple university system that shows the relationship between students and their universities.
The system should:

- Allow the user to view and add students.
- Allow linking a student to a university.
- Store this data using a basic database (SQL or even JSON file for simplicity).

### 💡 What we’re looking for:

- Clear frontend interface (HTML/CSS/JS).
- Basic backend with 1–2 APIs to handle data (Python, Java, or .NET).
- Simple database design: a table of students and a table of universities, and the relationship between them.

### 📄 What to Submit:

- Code files (Frontend and Backend).
- A short explanation of:
  - What the tool does
  - What you asked ChatGPT/Copilot
  - How you used the AI suggestions
  - Database design (simple ER diagram or explanation).

## 🧠 Part 2: Find and Fix the AI Bugs

The following is a malfunctioning webpage designed by AI. It has at least 5 bugs — some functional, some related to poor code practices, some visual. Your job is to identify and fix all issues. You can also use ChatGPT to help understand what’s wrong.

### 🧩 Code:

```html
<html>
<head><title>Student Page</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Students List</h2>
<ul id="studentList">
  <li>Ali</li>
  <li>Maya</li>
</ul>
<input type="text" id="name">
<button onclick="addStudent()">Add</button>
<script>
function addStudent() {
  let name = document.getElementById("Name").value;
  studentList.appendChild("<li>" + name + "</li>");
  alert('Student ' + name ' added');
}
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 🚨 Tasks:

- Find at least 5 issues.
- Fix the code.
- Explain each bug and how you solved it.

### ✅ What to Submit:

- Fixed HTML + JS code.
- Your explanation of the 5 bugs.
- Notes on how ChatGPT (or another AI tool) helped you.

## 🎤 Part 3: “AI-in-the-Loop” Reflection — Soft Skills and Ethics

"You are in an internship interview. The company wants to know your views about using AI like ChatGPT in coding. Answer the following in a 2-minute Loom video or 300-word essay:"

- How do you personally use AI tools as a developer?
- What are the limitations and risks of over-relying on AI for code generation?
- When is it ethical or unethical to use AI in software development?

## 📝 Submission Checklist:

- [x] Code files (Frontend & Backend).
- [x] Fixed Part 2 code + explanations.
- [x] AI usage explanations (for all parts).
- [x] Final reflection (written or voice).
- [x] Bonus: Deployment with Vercel is not intended for testing purposes only — we need to integrate it with a hosted database like Neon or MongoDB.

## 🕒 Deadline:

- You have 2–3 days to complete the test. Submit your answers by email or upload them through the provided form.
- Focus on learning, effort, and clear communication. It’s okay if everything isn’t perfect!
