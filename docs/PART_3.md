## Part 3: AI-in-the-Loop Reflection — Soft Skills and Ethics

- As a developer, I use AI tools like ChatGPT as a helpful assistant throughout my workflow. Whether I'm building backend logic, designing frontend interfaces, or debugging issues, AI helps me brainstorm ideas, learn new concepts, and write more efficient and well-structured code. I also use AI to improve how I express my thoughts clearly in English, especially in documentation and technical communication.

- AI plays an important role in boosting my productivity and learning speed. It helps me stay focused, explore better practices, and understand new technologies faster. I don’t just copy code—I use it to understand how and why something works, then apply it in my own way. It’s like having an experienced developer always ready to guide me.

- However, I recognize the limitations and risks of over-relying on AI. Code generated by AI may not always be optimal, secure, or up to date. Relying too much on it can prevent real learning and reduce problem-solving skills. That’s why I always take time to review and test AI-generated code, cross-check with trusted sources, and learn actively from every suggestion.

- Ethically, using AI in software development is acceptable when it supports learning, idea generation, or enhances productivity. But it becomes unethical when someone copies code blindly and claims it as their own work, especially in academic or team projects. It’s important to stay transparent and responsible in how AI is used.

- Overall, I see AI as a powerful tool—not a replacement—for thoughtful, human-driven development. It helps me grow as a developer and become more effective, creative, and professional in my work.
